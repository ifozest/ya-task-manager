You will also need to install:
On Unix:
 python  ( v2.7  recommended,  v3.x.x  is not supported)
 make
A proper C/C++ compiler toolchain, like GCC
On Windows:
Python ( v2.7.3  recommended,  v3.x.x  is not supported)
Windows XP/Vista/7:
Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 2010 (Express version works well)
For 64-bit builds of node and native modules you will also need the Windows 7 64-bit SDK
If the install fails, try uninstalling any C++ 2010 x64&x86 Redistributable that you have installed first.
If you get errors that the 64-bit compilers are not installed you may also need the compiler update for the Windows SDK 7.1
Windows 7/8:
Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 2012 for Windows Desktop (Express version works well)
